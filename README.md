## Information maximizing exploration in the feature space



### Experiments

1. Discrete control
  * Low dimensional states
    * Envs: Grid Maze
  * High dimensional states
    * Envs: Montezuma's Revenge
  * Split / Combined actor critic

2. Continuous control
  * Low dimensional states
    * Envs: Walker2D_X, Acrobot_X, Gather, Maze
  * High dimensional states (+joint high/low d)
    * Envs: Gather_Imgs, Acrobot_X_Imgs, Maze
  * Split / Combined actor critic

3. BNN computation time for varying sizes of states.

### Visualizations

1. Learned state mapping of values and uncertainties
2. Bonuses over a sequence.
